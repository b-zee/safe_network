# This workflow builds and packages the release artifacts, without actually running a release.
#
# It can sometimes be useful to obtain these binaries built from other branches, or a tag, or when
# the release process is being updated, this workflow can be used to test some of the changes.
#
# The built and packaged binaries will be attached to the workflow run as artifacts, available for
# download.
